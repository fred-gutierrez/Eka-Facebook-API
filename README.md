# Eka Bienes Raices
This project is a solution developed to showcase a Realtor's properties on a webpage. The main objective was to provide an easy-to-use and efficient way for the Realtor to display her properties without requiring advanced technical expertise. The solution utilizes NodeJS and Facebook's Graph API to fetch, filter, and exhibit the Realtor's Facebook posts directly on the webpage. Additionally, TypeScript and React have been employed to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability of the project.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Facebook Graph API
- NodeJS

## Project Overview
The Realtor's Properties Display Webpage is designed to streamline the process of presenting the Realtor's properties in an attractive and user-friendly manner. To achieve this, the following key features and technologies were utilized:
1. **Facebook's Graph API Integration** - The project integrates with Facebook's Graph API to fetch the Realtor's Facebook posts, which likely contain details about the properties she wants to showcase. By leveraging the Graph API, the solution ensures that the webpage automatically stays up-to-date with the latest posts on the Realtor's Facebook page.
2. **Eye-catching Image Carousel** - We've implemented an Image Carousel to showcase the Realtor's properties in a visually captivating way. This dynamic carousel leaves a lasting impression on the visitors, making property browsing an engaging experience.
3. **NodeJS Backend** - NodeJS is used to create a robust backend that handles the interaction with the Facebook Graph API. The backend is responsible for fetching and filtering the relevant data from the API, ensuring that only the Realtor's property-related posts are displayed on the webpage. 
5. **TypeScript for Maintainability** - TypeScript is employed throughout the project to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase. This helps catch potential errors during development, makes the codebase more maintainable.
6. **Tailwind CSS for Styling** - Tailwind CSS is used as the styling framework for the project, ensuring a sleek and modern design that complements the beautiful property images in the carousel.
