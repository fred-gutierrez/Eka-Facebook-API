# Project Repository Update

**IMPORTANT: This Repository Is No Longer in Use**

This project has been updated to incorporate the Next.js framework for improved performance, enhanced SEO, and a better user experience. As a result, the code and resources for this project have been moved to a new repository.

You can now find the latest version of this project at the following repository:

Please make sure to update your bookmarks and references to the new repository to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and improvements. We apologize for any inconvenience this change may cause, but we believe that the benefits offered by Next.js make this transition worthwhile.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues with the new repository, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for your continued support and interest in this project.

Sincerely,

Fred
