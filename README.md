This project is a solution developed to showcase a Realtor's properties on a webpage. The main objective was to provide an easy-to-use and efficient way for the Realtor to display her properties without requiring advanced technical expertise. The solution utilizes NodeJS and Facebook's Graph API to fetch, filter, and exhibit the Realtor's Facebook posts directly on the webpage. Additionally, TypeScript and React have been employed to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability of the project.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Facebook Graph API
- NodeJS

## Project Overview
The Realtor's Properties Display Webpage is designed to streamline the process of presenting the Realtor's properties in an attractive and user-friendly manner. To achieve this, the following key features and technologies were utilized:
### 1. Facebook's Graph API Integration
The project integrates with Facebook's Graph API to fetch the Realtor's Facebook posts, which likely contain details about the properties she wants to showcase. By leveraging the Graph API, the solution ensures that the webpage automatically stays up-to-date with the latest posts on the Realtor's Facebook page.
### 2. NodeJS Backend
NodeJS is used to create a robust backend that handles the interaction with the Facebook Graph API. The backend is responsible for fetching and filtering the relevant data from the API, ensuring that only the Realtor's property-related posts are displayed on the webpage.
### 3. React Frontend
The frontend of the webpage is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive components, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for potential clients visiting the Realtor's properties display webpage.
### 4. TypeScript for Maintainability
TypeScript is employed throughout the project to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase. This helps catch potential errors during development, makes the codebase more maintainable, and provides better tooling support for the developers.
### 5. Tailwind CSS for Styling
Tailwind CSS is used as the styling framework for the project. It offers a utility-first approach to styling, making it easier to build responsive and visually appealing UI components without the need to write custom CSS from scratch.
